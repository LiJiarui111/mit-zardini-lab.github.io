Luigi Di Lillo is an applied physicist, renowned for his work in advanced mathematical modelling and logical formalism.

A visionary in his field, he is also an affiliated researcher at Harvard University, Stanford University, and ETH Zurich's Labs.

During his tenure at General Electric Global Research and Swiss Reinsurance Company, he developed probabilistic frameworks for machine learning and Bayesian decision theory, pioneered state-of-the-art statistical methods for forecasting and predictive analytics, led teams of mathematicians, physicists, product managers, and crafted novel partnerships (e.g., Waymo -Google- and Luminar).

In the context of his collaboration with the Zardini Lab, Luigi pioneers work on the algorithmic foundations of decision making and the theoretical foundations and practical implications of risk assessment in complex networks.
