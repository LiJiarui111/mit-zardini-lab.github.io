Marius is a second year PhD student in Mathematics, advised by Prof. Alberto Cattaneo at the University of Zurich.  
His project uses applied category theory to model biological systems. It is funded by the Digital Society Initiative Excellence Programm Scholarship. He explains some of the mathematics he is using in this series of videos. 

He holds a masters in Interdisciplinary Sciences (Biology and Chemistry) from ETH and a bachelors in Mathematics from the University of Zurich.

He has been thinking about choice and time in codesign together with Jonathan Lorand and Gioele Zardini. Previous work resulted in a semester paper on modeling choice in codesign. Currently, he is trying to introduce concurrency to codesign using linear logic.
