Maximilian Stölzle is a Ph.D. candidate at Delft University of Technology, Netherlands working on modeling and control for continuum soft robots. 
He is visiting the Zardini Lab at MIT in fall 2024 to work on co-designing soft robots.
He received a B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering and an M.S. degree with distinction in Mechanical Engineering in 2019 and 2021 respectively both from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, Switzerland.
Previously, he visited the Planetary Robotics Lab at the European Space Agency working on using self-supervised learning for removing occlusions in terrain maps. His research interests center around developing minimalistic models and control strategies (both model-based and data-driven) for soft robots.

### Awards:
- Best Paper Award at 2024 IEEE 7th International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft).
- Graduated with distinction from the MSc in Mechanical Engineering at ETH Zurich.
- Received MathWorks poster award at the RoboSoft 2023 workshop on Reduced-Order Modelling for Soft Robots.
- Received the Swiss-European Mobility for Traineeship Scholarship for research stay at ESTEC, European Space Agency (ESA).
- Received the UCL Mechanical Engineering Undergraduate Vacation Studentship for research
project on Reinforcement Learning Control for Unmanned Surface Vehicles.
