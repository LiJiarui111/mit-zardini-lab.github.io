Mingjia is a doctoral student at the Institute of Dynamic Systems and Control (IDSC), ETH Zurich, co-advised by Prof. Zardini. Her research explores strategic interactions in multi-agent autonomous systems, with the goal of developing control strategies and cooperative mechanisms that redefine what is possible in future mobility.

She is passionate about leveraging advances in game theory and optimization techniques to build more intelligent, efficient, and resilient mobility systems. The applications of her work span diverse mobility systems, including railway systems, urban multi-modal transit networks, and autonomous on-demand mobility services.
