Gioele will be an Assistant Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from fall 2024, where he is part of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, a Principal Investigator in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, and an Affiliated Faculty with the Institute for Data, Systems and Society.

He received his doctoral degree in 2024 from ETH Zurich, and holds both a BSc. and a MSc. in Mechanical Engineering and Robotics, Systems and control from ETH Zurich.

Before joining MIT as a faculty, he is a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford University, and held various visiting positions at nuTonomy Singapore (then Aptiv, now Motional), Stanford, and MIT.

Driven by societal challenges, the goal of his research is to develop efficient computational tools and algorithmic approaches to formulate and solve complex, interconnected system design and autonomous decision making problems.

His interests include the co-design complex systems, all the way from future mobility systems to autonomous systems, compositionality in engineering, planning and control, and game theory.

He is the recipient of an award (keynote talk) at the 2021 Applied Category Theory Conference, and of the Best Paper Award (1st Place) at the 2021 24th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC).
